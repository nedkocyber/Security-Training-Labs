# Coming Soon...
# Overview
This repository contains a collection of intentionally vulnerable labs designed to simulate real‑world systems, services, and environments. Each lab includes common misconfigurations, insecure setups, and exploitable vulnerabilities that can be used for hands‑on security training, research, and practice.
The goal of this project is to provide a safe and controlled environment where learners can explore how different weaknesses work, understand how they are exploited, and improve their skills in identifying and mitigating security issues across various technologies — not only web applications, but also system‑level and network‑level components.
# Purpose
• 	To offer practical, real‑world‑inspired vulnerable scenarios

• 	To help learners practice exploitation techniques in a legal and controlled environment

• 	To demonstrate how misconfigurations and poor security practices can lead to compromise

• 	To serve as a growing collection of CTF‑style challenges for training and experimentation

# Notes
This project will continue to expand with new labs, vulnerabilities, and challenge scenarios over time.
It is intended strictly for educational, research, and testing purposes.
