# Security-Training-Labs
This repository contains a collection of intentionally vulnerable labs designed to simulate real‑world systems, services, and environments with common misconfigurations and security flaws. The goal is to provide a practical hands‑on platform for learning, testing, and experimenting with a wide range of vulnerabilities across different technologies.
